Automated Zoom Login Program
Introduction
In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, the transition to online learning presented unique challenges, particularly in maintaining consistent attendance across numerous and often inconveniently scheduled Zoom classes. To address this, I developed an Automated Zoom Login and Recording Program. This project not only streamlined my attendance process but also served as a practical application of my skills in Object Oriented Programming and encapsulation.

Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project was to eliminate the manual hassle of logging into Zoom classes, which were frequent and at odd hours. Automating this process allowed me to maintain perfect attendance without the need for constant manual intervention.

Objective
The program aims to automate the login process for scheduled Zoom classes and record them, ensuring that students can maintain attendance and review lectures with minimal effort. The convenience it offers, especially for students with back-to-back classes or classes at odd hours, is a significant relief.

Tools and Technologies Used
Python: Chosen for its simple syntax, Python allowed me to focus on the program's logic and functionality.
Libraries:
pyAutoGui: This library facilitated the automation of GUI interactions, such as inputting credentials and joining classes.
DateTime & Schedule: These were crucial for scheduling the script to run at specific class times.
Bandicam: An external screen recording software used to record meetings.

Features
Automatic Zoom Login: The program automates the process of logging into scheduled Zoom meetings, ensuring timely attendance.
Meeting Recording: Utilizes Bandicam to record meetings, allowing for later review.
Schedule Management: Leverages Python's DateTime and Schedule libraries to execute the script according to the class timetable.

Challenges and Learning
Throughout this project, I encountered and overcame several challenges, including:
Navigating Zoom's GUI programmatically using pyAutoGui, which required precise control and coordination.
Scheduling the script's execution to align with the class timetable, ensuring reliability and punctuality.
This project was instrumental in enhancing my understanding of Object Oriented Programming and the practical application of encapsulation. It also highlighted the importance of automation in solving real-world problems.

**Conclusion**
This Automated Zoom Login and Recording Program stands out for its practical utility in ensuring consistent attendance and facilitating the review of online lectures. It exemplifies the power of automation in enhancing the online learning experience.
